Notes regarding github so far:



- Create your repository at github.com/new
- After creating your repository, copy the SSH key and return to you terminal
- Once in the terminal, enter the desired directory where you want the repository to live
- Once there, type git clone (and then paste your SSH Key)
- Your repository is now remotely connected from your computer to Github
- Enter the newly cloned directory by doing cd (input directory name)
- To begin adding files, you can type *code (file name)* could be .txt or .md or .py or whatever
- After saving your files, you can then check thes status of your repository to see if any changes have been
- Check for those changes by typing Git Status
- To add those changed, type Git Add (the file name desired)
- Then double check that the file has been updated by typing git status again (file should be green)
- Prepare the file (seal the envelope) by typing git commit -m "type an explanation of what you are commiting)
- To send the file to github, finish this process by typing 
    - git push and hit return
- To verify the changes were made, check the status of your repository at github.com to confirm

# Let's add a few more notes to complete this exercise

- **Please remember** that case matters so all git commands in the terminal need to be *lowercase*, disregard the case usage above. 
    - If it isn't done in lowercase, the commands will not work.
